Cirquity is a private, fast, secure and easy way to send money to friends and businesses. Allowing you to be your own bank.

#

## What is Cirquity

Our coin is based on Cryptonote technology and using CN Turtle algorithm. Our goal for Cirquity is to be used on any aspect of transactions globally.

## Why Cirquity is created

Mainly because there are many limits when sending money, making transactions in different currencies or different banks and countries. The cost is high, and you have no control over it. However, using Bitcoin involves non-secure or non-anonymous transactions.

## What are we doing

With the blockchain-based cryptocurrency Cirquity, transactions will be faster, private and secure. Unlike Bitcoin, Cirquity transactions are anonymous. By implementing Lite-Blocks to reduce the size of our blockchain, allowing normal users to participate in our network without having expensive equipment. Thus, building a CirqPay payment system with a minimum transaction cost to allow everyone to pay and make comfortable and fast transactions. Having a community focus blockchain, Cirquity is own by everyone allowing the decentralization of the currency.
