## Daemon and Wallet
#
### How can I re-sync the blockchain?

Close any `Cirquity` related software, then go to `%APPDATA%`, and delete the `Cirquity` folder.  
Reopen `cirquityd` / `the GUI wallet` and let it re-sync.

Alternatively, check [this guide](/guides/wallet#using-checkpoints) for instructions on how to use checkpoints for a quicker sync, or try a [remote node](/guides/wallet#using-remote-nodes)

### I'm getting a "corrupted blockchain" error like this?

```bash

### I'm getting a "Genesis block hash was not found" error like this?

##### Using Desktop GUI
* Backup your wallet then close your GUI Wallet
* Delete the `.wallet` file
* Then open the GUI Wallet and re-import your wallet. It should start counting up the blocks and printing out your transactions as it gets to them.
#
### I've opened the wallet, and I'm getting lots of messages like "Your cirquityd isn't fully synced yet!"

```bash
Until you are fully synced, you wonâ€™t be able to send transactions, and your balance may be missing or incorrect!
```

Your daemon hasn't finished syncing yet. Keep cirquity-wallet open, and wait until you are `0` days behind the current block, and for the daemon to print out a green message saying `Successfully synchronized with the Cirquity Network`.  
You can also type status in the daemon and press enter to see the current height it's at.
